          <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
          <p>Hi! My name is Jon, a native Texan living in Montana. I grew up in Boerne, TX (just north of San Antonio)
            and have always loved the outdoors. I knew before I graduated high school I wanted to go to the greatest
            University in the country. Texas A&M University, gig 'em Ags!</p>

          <h2>What I've done</h2>
          <p>The first job I had after graduating Texas A&M was as an Armor Officer in the US Army. I served as a
            platoon leader, XO, and S4 at Ft. Bliss, TX and deployed to Kuwait as a part of the 1st Armored Division. I
            moved to Ft. Benning, GA to serve as a Troop Commander for a basic training unit and as the S3 for 5-15 CAV.
            After the military I moved to Ft. Worth, TX and took a job as a program manager for GE Transportation. I
            knew I always wanted to live out west and took a job as a medical salesman in Bozeman, MT. I covered the
            entire state as my territory. Right now I'm contiuing my education with Code Fellows as a software
            developer.</p>
