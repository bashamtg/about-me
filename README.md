  - Learned to utilize the ctrl with mouse click to change multiple lines of code at once
  - best to have a good wire frame **then** build your site, give more direction then wasting time going straight in
  - do each type of language first then move on to the next (ex: HTML, CSS, then JS).work in html first and build the framework, then make it look good with CSS, and make it run in JS.  I worked better not bouncing around to each but focusing on one at a time.
  - don't make things too over complicated, assignments are due, time is limited
  - keep taking good notes, they've been really helpful
  - practice good ACP, its only gonna make things easier later on
  - I did really well with understanding gitflow procedures, I taught someone how to do it and they learned well.

  - I'm stronger in CSS and HTML then I thought
  - I learned that inside the {} of a for loop is where the loop will continue to get executed the number of times you tell it to run based on the () after the for
